         <h3>Interest&hobbies</h3>
        </div>
         <ul>
            <li>I like watching psychopathic movies.</li>

    <div id="One piece">
    <h3>One piece</h3>
</div>
    <p>Best anime to ever grace the anime community. It starts of slow however when it picks up you will understand how amzing it is.</p>

    <p>One piece is not ike all the other shonen manga/animes in my opinion, even tho the pacing is horrible, The story lines add up for it. In this story we follow him on his journey to become the Pirate king,(a title only one man has accomplished so far), as he defeats countless of foes who try to deteriarate his dream. in my opinion i will call this anime a masterpiece as it shows a never ending will which would motivate one to never give up.</p>
