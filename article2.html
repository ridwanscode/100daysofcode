        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Bill Gates, in full William Henry Gates The third, is an american computer programmer and entrepreneur who cofounded microsoft corparation,</br>
            the worlds largest personal computer software.At age 13, Gates created his first piece of software.</br>
            He assisted in the formation of a group of programmers in high school who computerised the payroll system at their school and went on to start Traf-O-Data,</br>
            a business that marketed traffic-counting systems to local governments. As a sophomore at Harvard University in 1975, Gates teamed up with his classmate Paul G.</br>
            Allen from his hometown to create the first microcomputers' software. They started by converting the well-liked macro-based BASIC programming language for usage on small computers.</br>
             After this endeavour was a success, Gates quit Harvard in his sophomore year and co-founded Microsoft with Allen.</p>
        <p> When Microsoft licenced the MS-DOS operating system to International Business Machines Corporation, at the time the largest computer supplier and industry leader,</br> 
            for use on its first microcomputer, the IBM PC, Gates' influence over the nascent microcomputer industry expanded significantly (personal computer).</br>
            Following the machine's introduction in 1981, IBM established the technical bar for the PC industry swiftly, and MS-DOS did the same for other operating systems.</br>
            While Microsoft's independence caused tensions with IBM, Gates skillfully used the larger organisation to make it reliant on him for essential software.</br>
             Microsoft was also used by manufacturers of clones, or PCs that are compatible with IBM. By the beginning of the 1990s, he had evolved as the PC industry's ultimate kingmaker.</p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Education
            Gates was a voracious reader as a child, spending many hours poring over reference books such as the encyclopedia. Around the age of 11 or 12, Gates's parents began to have concerns about his behavior.</br>
            He was doing well in school, but he seemed bored and withdrawn at times, and his parents worried he might become a loner.Though they were strong believers in public education, when Gates turned 13,</br>
            his parents enrolled him at Seattle's exclusive preparatory Lakeside School. He blossomed in nearly all his subjects, excelling in math and science, but also doing very well in drama and English.</br>
            While at Lakeside School, a Seattle computer company offered to provide computer time for the students. The Mother's Club used proceeds from the school's rummage sale to purchase a teletype terminal for students to use.</br>
            Gates became entranced with what a computer could do and spent much of his free time working on the terminal. He wrote a tic-tac-toe program in BASIC computer language that allowed users to play against the computer.</br>
            Gates graduated from Lakeside in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the college SAT test, a feat of intellectual achievement that he boasted about for several years when introducing himself to new people.</p>
        <h2>Networth</h2>
        <p> Gates’ net worth is estimated to be $132.1 billion, although it has ranged over $150 billion at various points,</br>
             with much of the reduction of Gates’ net worth believed to be associated with his charitable giving to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</br>
              While it is not a title he currently holds, Gates was once the richest man in the world.</p>
