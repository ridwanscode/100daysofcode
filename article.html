        <h1>The ghost of the forest.</h1>
        <h2>Dominant specie with stealth like attacks.</h2>
        <h3>By Ridwan Dhicisow</h3>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Large felines in the genus Panthera are referred to as black panthers in colloquial language when,</br>
             they have a coat of black fur or prominent black patches on a dark background.</br>
             Black coat coloration is attributed to the expression of recessive alleles in leopards and dominant alleles in jaguars.</br>
              In each species, a certain combination of alleles stimulates the production of large amounts of the dark pigment melanin in the animalâ€™s fur and skin.</br>
              Although melanin concentrations often vary between members of the same litter, individuals displaying completely black coats are rare.</p>
        <p>Other elements, such as the direction of the light's incidence and the animal's stage of development, may also affect how a black coat appears.</br>
             For instance, certain melanistic leopards and jaguars have completely black coats because diffuse light may conceal the finer details of their fur.</br>
             However, the coat's slight spotted design may become visible in direct sunshine.</br>
             Additionally, the preservation of black patches from the juvenile stage into maturity, which may compliment other concentrations of dark-colored fur,</br>
              may result in blackened or almost blackened coats. Seasonal colour changes may also account for the appearance of black or almost black fur in other animals,</br>
             such as the lynx (Lynx).</p>
        <h2>Behaviour and lifestyle</h2>
        <p>The Panther is an incredibly intelligent and agile animal that is very seldom seen by people in the wild as they are generally very quiet and cautious animals. </br>
            Their dark brown fur camouflages the Panther both into the surrounding forest and makes them almost invisible in the darkness of night.</br>
            The Panther is a solitary animal that leads a nocturnal lifestyle, spending much of the daylight hours resting safely high in the trees. Like both the Leopard and the Jaguar,</br>
            Panthers are incredible climbers and they not only rest in the trees but they are also able to keep a watchful eye out for prey without being spotted.</br>
            The Panther is an incredibly powerful and fearless animal that is feared by many,due to the fact that they are also very aggressive.</br>
            The Panther is very territorial particularly males whose home ranges overlap those of a number of females and they are threatened by another male</p>
        <h2>Diet and pray</h2>
        <p>Because they are often very quiet and careful creatures, people very rarely encounter the extremely clever and agile panther in the wild.</br>
            The Panther is virtually undetectable in the nighttime darkness thanks to its dark brown fur, which blends them with the nearby woodland. </br>
            The Panther is a lone creature that lives a nocturnal existence, sleeping for the majority of the day in the safety of the woods. Panthers are excellent climbers,</br>
            just like the Leopard and Jaguar, and they may rest in trees while keeping a vigilant look out for prey without being seen. Many people dread the panther because it is a very strong and fearless animal.</p>
